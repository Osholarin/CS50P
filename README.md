## Course Overview

The Harvard CS50 Introduction to Programming with Python course is designed to introduce students to the art of programming and computer science. Using Python, one of the most versatile and widely-used programming languages, the course covers a broad range of topics from basic syntax to more advanced programming paradigms.

## Course Topics

Here is a breakdown of the key topics covered in the course:

1. **Functions and Variables**  
   Learn about defining functions, variable scope, and best practices for writing reusable code.

2. **Conditionals**  
   Explore the use of `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to control the flow of your programs based on different conditions.

3. **Loops**  
   Understand `for` and `while` loops, how to iterate over data structures, and when to use each type.

4. **Exceptions**  
   Handle errors gracefully using `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to create more robust applications.

5. **Libraries**  
   Discover the power of Python's standard library and how to import and utilize external libraries to extend the functionality of your programs.

6. **Unit Tests**  
   Learn how to write unit tests to ensure your code works as expected, using frameworks like `unittest`.

7. **File I/O**  
   Read from and write to files, working with different file formats and handling data persistence.

8. **Regular Expressions**  
   Use regular expressions to search, match, and manipulate strings with precision.

9. **Object-Oriented Programming**  
   Dive into OOP principles, including classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation, to structure your code more effectively.

10. **Et Cetera**  
    Cover additional topics like web programming, data science, and other advanced Python features as time permits.
